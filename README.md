# Real-time-QRS-detection
## Purpose
A reliable QRS recognition algorithm would be of critical use in clinical senarios. The code, inspired by Pan & Tompkins, can hopefully realize a real-time analysis of heart rate, Bradycardia, Tachycardia, Premature ventricular contractions and Atrial premature beats.
## Reference
The algorithm is based on the paper: 
>Pan J, Tompkins W J. A real-time QRS detection algorithm[J]. IEEE transactions on biomedical engineering, 1985 (3): 230-236.

## Code Structure
**ECG_demo**: main function. It will plot the ECG signal in real time.   

**rate_cal**: calculate real-time heart rate. It has been optimized for time efficiency.   

**ECG_diagnosis**: abnormality judgement. All the results would be printed in the cammand line.   
## Example
The data (200Hz, 1min length) has already been uploaded. Say we use 7.txt for evaluation. The results would be as follows:

After loading all the data, the average heart rate and diagnosis results would be available.

All the QRS detection results would be visualized as follows:

## Future Releases
A version with a GUI and interface to serial port of MCU may be available in the future.
